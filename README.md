# My Complete Guide to the B.Sc Computer Science at University of Manitoba
*NOTE: your experience may vary*

## üëã Introduction and Purpose

After finishing my degree and starting my professional career, I thought it
would be useful to share my honest and candid experience of what it was like
obtaining my CS degree. I will also share my tips and opinions (fwiw) to help
guide others in their journey. Please note that this is just my personal
opinion and experience, take it with a grain of salt and know that your 
journey will be much more different, and the curriculum for some classes might
have changed since I graduated (languages, tools, etc). 
I hope it will at least help someone!

>‚ùóÔ∏è
>For each course, I provide a rating of difficulty and enjoyment. This is
>totally subjective, but I think will give you an idea of what to expect out
>of the class.

### More about me
I was a totally average student throughout my time within the faculty. I am
by no means an elite student. I would actually characterize myself as 
someone who is pretty ass tbh. However, I was able to learn a lot about
myself and what I was good at, and what I wasn't. You should read this
from the perspective of an average and relatable student. Despite this,
I was still selected to be a part of the co-op program which I will touch
upon later (very important!).

## ‚úèÔ∏è YEAR ONE

In your first year within the faculty, after completing U1 and declaring your major,
you will begin with your first year introductory courses (duh). These classes will
get you started on the absolute basics of CS and what is to come. For a lot of people,
this can be a very difficult time. For people who haven't coded in high school or
earlier, it takes a lot of getting used to. Some people can be really good with the
accessory skills in CS, such as math and statistics. However, coding is much more
different and requires you to look at problems in a different, but similar fashion.

### Introductory Computer Science 1
An introduction to computer programming using a procedural high level language, ["COMP 1010".](https://catalog.umanitoba.ca/search/?P=COMP%201010)
In this class, we got started with learning Processing. We learned how to complete
graphics-based projects, such as creating a pong style game, making a ball move
back and forth on a line, etc. It eventually builds up in scale to where you are 
creating video-game style projects that utilize the basic CS fundamentals, such
as arrays, booleans, math, and more.

#### Difficulty - 6/10
```
This class is not necessarily one of the most difficult classes. I gave it a 6/10
as I expect it to be a difficult ramp up period for those who have never ever
coded before. This will be very important as you will need to put in a lot of
effort into learning how the fundamentals work, ie., arrays, variables, etc. You
will most likely be in a huge class, and this is the time to fight any shyness
you might have and start making friends!
Use this to get into study groups and explore and join any extracurricular clubs.
This is not something that profs will teach you, so it is important to start
learning to take advantage of networking ASAP.
```

#### Enjoyment - 8/10
```
The subject matter of the course was really cool, and if you have a passion for
video games, this could be the course that gives you a taste of what to
expect (more on video games later).
```

### Introductory Computer Science 2
More features of a procedural language, elements of programming, ["COMP 1020".](https://catalog.umanitoba.ca/search/?P=COMP%201020)
In this class, you will expand on the fundamentals by learning about OOP, exceptions,
error handling, data structures, etc. There is not too much to say about this class.
It is an extension of the first class, and introduces more concepts that are 
fundamental to CS.

#### Difficulty - 6.5/10
```
This class is similar to COMP1010. If you put in effort to understand the
fundamentals introduced into that class, you will do well in this class.
I rate it a little bit more difficult than 1010 because it is slightly more
advanced (things like recursion can be tough to understand). Try hard to
understand everything conceptually, then apply them to the assignments.
```

#### Enjoyment - 3/10
```
Nothing too interesting. It is quite bland and not very exciting, but it
will end up being very important to laying down your foundation in
software engineering.
```

### MATH 1240 Elementary Discrete Mathematics
An introduction to mathematical ideas, proof, techniques, and mathematical writing, 
explored through topics in discrete mathematics, ["MATH 1240".](https://catalog.umanitoba.ca/search/?P=MATH%201240)

OK.

This class.

You have heard about this class (I'm absolutely sure of it). 

If you have not, I will tell you now.

This is arguably the most difficult class you will take in your degree.
It requires you to think and do math in a way you have probably never done
before. It requires you to have advanced critical thinking skills and you
need to be able to put your thoughts into writing. If you are an international
student with limited confidence in English, this could be more difficult.
This class is like a tough gatekeeper for those who can cut it to make it in
CS, or not.

I was never a great math student, in fact, I really did not like math at all.
However, I still managed to pass this class. If I can do it, so can you.
I did not want to scare you too much with that intro, but this really is
a tough class. I would recommend taking this class alongside electives
or anything you will find to be easy and have a lower workload.

Practice writing proofs over and over. I do not think this is a class where
you just understand what each part of the proof does and go on. You need
to practice the application of everything you learn so that you can
pass the exams.

#### Difficulty - 10/10
```
Arguably the hardest class you will take. Fully deserving of the 10/10 if
you are not a math geek. There are also additional factors such as requiring
decent skill in written English if you are an international student.
```

#### Enjoyment - 5/10
```
I was thinking of putting this lower, maybe a 2, but the concepts learned
in this class are actually really interesting. The difficulty of the
course made it really difficult to enjoy, but looking back it was
actually really helpful. It will teach you how to problem solve and prove
the ideas you have in your head.
```


### MATH 1300, 1500, 1700
Geometry, Algebra, and Calculus. It is just math. There is nothing too much
to say about these classes. I am not good at math so I did have moments where
I was struggling. This is not going to be as difficult as MATH 1240, and honestly,
I did not find these to be helpful for me. I think MATH 1300 was the most helpful
as it will directly relate to Computer Graphics (3000 level course) and video game
development if you want to get into that. Other than that, I think you will
not be surprised by anything offered by these classes.


#### Difficulty - 5/10
```
It's math. You are good or you aren't. If you aren't, like me, you need to spend
extra time studying.
```

#### Enjoyment - 1/10
```
Nothing interesting, tbh. I felt that these classes were just something I needed
to get out of the way as it is a requirement for CS. meh.
```

## ‚úåÔ∏è YEAR TWO
With those introductory courses out of the way, we start getting into some real
important classes. This is also the year that will introduce you to the co-op
program. This co-op program is very competitive, and if accepted, will put you
in a much more advantageous position post-graduation. This will be a year where
you will absolutely need to lock in. real heavy hitters for this one guys. fr.

However, before we get into that. Let's talk about something that really
changed this school forever. I am talking about

## COVID-19
Yeah, so pretty much, everyone was getting sick and no one could go to school.
This made it so we had to watch lectures from Zoom and we could no longer study
the way we were used to. After Covid, things changed permanently (imo). I felt like
visiting office hours were not touched upon, or encouraged, as often as they used
to, and academic integrity was definitely being violated by a lot of people.
I'm gonna take this time to give you my honest advice.

Talk to your profs before or after class. Ask questions about course material.
Ask them about any research they are doing. Ask them if they know of any things
you can get into within the faculty. During Covid, this wasn't something I was
able to do. As a result, I was not able to network and create relationships with
the figures within the department. If you put in the effort to talk with your profs,
whether you are just curious, or you need help with assignments, you will be much
more successful.

Cheating. I knew a lot of people were cheating. Do not cheat. You will eventually
get caught. Also, you are setting yourself up for failure. Good paying jobs will
require technical interviews. You cannot fake it until you make it unless you are
an expert BSer or incredibly lucky.

Ok back to classes.

### Analysis of Algorithms
Methods of analyzing the time and space requirements of algorithms. Average case and worst case analysis. 
Models of computation., ["COMP 2080".](https://catalog.umanitoba.ca/search/?P=COMP%202080)
This class is like MATH 1240 v1.5. Not as crazy, but kind of tying those MATH concepts you
learned directly into CS. More proofs. Pseudocode. Critical thinking (analyzing algorithms).
Weighted graphs. Stuff like that. 

#### Difficulty - 7.5/10
```
Quite difficult. Not as bad as MATH1240 because by now you've already passed that class
and you can now apply those skills directly into concepts related to CS.
```

#### Enjoyment - 6/10
```
This class will be very interesting for those who want to get into research and masters
programs. If you want to get more into academia, research, that kind of stuff, this
will be cool for you. For me, it was decently interesting, but not my thing. Still
had fun. 6/10.
```

### Data Structures and Algorithms
Introduction to the representation and manipulation of data structures. Topics will include lists, 
stacks, queues, trees, and graphs., ["COMP 2140".](https://catalog.umanitoba.ca/search/?P=COMP%202140)
A really important class for those who are ambitious about working in FAANG and any top
tech company. This will introduce some very important fundamentals for software development.
Nothing about this class will surprise you. It is pretty straight forward, and not too
difficult. Save all notes of this class for future preparation. Technical interviews will
be testing you on these concepts.

#### Difficulty - 6/10
```
Nothing too difficult. The concepts learned in this class are things you are going to end
up using again and again. If you want to lean into development and engineering, put
lots of focus into this class and master these concepts.
```

#### Enjoyment - 7/10
```
Really cool stuff introduced. After you finish this class, I would say you are starting
to become a real programmer.
```

## CO-OP Program
So during the first sem of your second year, you will probably get a presentation about
the co-op program. I won't detail it here because you will get the presentation anyway,
but you basically get to work as a student.

This is extremely beneficial to your career. Try your best to get in if your life
circumstances allow you. You can succeed without it, but with the way the industry is
right now, experience is going to help you in ways I cannot put into words. Co-op allowed
me to buy a car, which allowed me to get other jobs, which made me more money, which got
me experience to get other jobs.

I cannot recommend the program enough. It is a respected program in Canada. It is really good.

What is the process like to get in?

You will need to be interviewed, and there will be many factors affecting your chances. You
should have decent grades. You should be enthusiastic about the opportunity. You should have
personal passion projects done. It doesn't have to be anything amazing. Just do something
you will enjoy doing. Maybe a small video game, or a website. anything. I made a dumb little
crypto thing. It was something to talk about in the interview, and I ended getting accepted.
At the time, my grades were probably above average? Maybe like between B and A-.

If you are strategic, you can take a lot of easy electives early and inflate your GPA before
co-op admission time. Your choice. Back to classes.

### Object Orientation
Design and development of object-oriented software. Topics will include inheritance, polymorphism, 
data abstraction and encapsulation. Examples will be drawn from several programming languages., ["COMP 2150".](https://catalog.umanitoba.ca/search/?P=COMP%202150)
A class that goes deep into OOP principles. A fun class that teaches how to take ideas and
build it into something real. I took this class with Domaratzki. He is absolutely GOATED.
The best prof I ever had. Really wish he could stay at the U of M but is it what it is.
If he ever happens to be instructing any class you can register for, just take it.

#### Difficulty - 4/10
```
Nothing too difficult. Expanding on classes, objects, instantiation, etc.
```

#### Enjoyment - 10/10
```
One of the most enjoyable classes I took. Mr. Dom made it enjoyable. Everything was easy to
learn. I think I did some hockey sim stuff for one of the assignments. 10/10.
```

### Programming Practices
Introduction to issues involved in real-world computing. Topics will include memory management, debugging, 
compilation, performance, and good programming practices., ["COMP 2160".](https://catalog.umanitoba.ca/search/?P=COMP%202160)
This is a hard class. It goes into low level programming and you will have to do a
lot of the things manually that you have been used to have being done for you.
Memory management, pointers, using makefiles. This can be tough, but it is 
important to know for future classes (operating systems!).

#### Difficulty - 7.5/10
```
Lots to consider. Need to be detail oriented and also concise. Not the most difficult but
definitely not the easiest.
```

#### Enjoyment - 5/10
```
Interesting to know how things work under the hood. Could end up being useful for those
working in low level environments, embedded, OS, etc.
```

### Introduction to Computer Systems
Data representation and manipulation, machine-level representation of programs, assembly language programming, 
and basic computer architecture., ["COMP 2280".](https://catalog.umanitoba.ca/search/?P=COMP%202280)
More low level programming, going down to assembly. Very similar to what computer
engineering students are doing. You are working with binary, circuits, gates, etc.

#### Difficulty - 6/10
```
Not very difficult. The low level programming can be a bit hard to get used to, but it
also might be something you are good at. Consider this and other low level programming
courses if you want to get into robotics, hardware, etc.
```

#### Enjoyment - 3/10
```
Not my personal taste. I prefer higher level languages but thats just me. Lots of people
like working on the low level side!
```

## ü§ñ YEAR THREE
This is where you start moving on from fundamentals, and start making personal choices to
study things you are personally interested in. Take time in the summer before registration
to think about what you might be into and register accordingly. Also know that your interests
might change over time. You can like things at first, then by the end, hate it. This is a time
to find out what you might want to do in your career.

### Software Engineering 1
Introduction to software engineering. Software life cycle models, system and software requirements analysis, 
specifications, software design, testing and maintenance, software quality. ["COMP 3350".](https://catalog.umanitoba.ca/search/?P=COMP%203350)
A course where you will be forced to work on a long term project in a group. This can go
really bad, or really good. We're not gonna know. For me, I was paired up with some 
smart people and it was totally a breeze. They were chill for the most part. There was
one time where things got heated on discord. This is where you will learn to work with
others where there is something on the line (your GPA). Try your best to work as a team.
Be nice and understanding. Be helpful. Don't try to carry the project. Do your part.

#### Difficulty - 6.5/10
```
This is hard to grade because there are many variables to your success. The kind of
project you end up doing, your group, etc. We did our project in Android which was
not too difficult.
```

#### Enjoyment - 8/10
```
I was lucky to get a good group. One or two other people were also in coop.
Things went smoothly. I have kept in touch with them after grad through
linkedin. Learned about working in a team which is crucial for working post-grad.
```

### Operating Systems
Operating systems, their design, implementation, and usage. ["COMP 3430".](https://catalog.umanitoba.ca/search/?P=COMP%203430)
A difficult class taking you into the lower level workings of OS concepts. You
will work with the shell and cmd line. You will create scripts. You will work in aviary.
You will work with threads. This is one of the harder classes you need to take.


#### Difficulty - 8.5/10
```
Very difficult. I remember needing to pull an all-nighter to finish one of the
assignments on time. I think I took this with Bristow. Most of his classes
are usually difficult. If you had trouble with the low level programming courses,
consider taking this with two other (easy) electives.
```

#### Enjoyment - 7/10
```
Pretty interesting. Working in the shell, creating scripts, working with threads
and considering performance, these are all skills you utilize post-grad.
```

### Human-Computer Interaction 1
Human-computer interaction: human factors and usability, user-centered design, 
prototyping, usability evaluation, COMP 3020 (not a degree requirement).
A class that introduces you to web development, UI/UX, and front end concepts.
You have to do self learning and you have to work in a group. Take this class
if web development interests you.


#### Difficulty - 5/10
```
Not difficult, but working in a group can make it hard. You also need to spend
time on your own learning how to do web development. The things to consider in
COMP3350 you consider here.
```

#### Enjoyment - 7/10
```
Really cool. Lots of things I learned I never considered, like how people will
view the work that you do, how it can be used, how easily it can be used, etc.
Must take for those who want to be a great web dev!
```

### Databases Concepts and Usage
An introduction to database systems including the relational, hierarchical, network and 
entity-relationship models with emphasis on the relational model and SQL, COMP 3380. This
should be taken by those who want to work on the back end. You learn all about
databases, joining, queries, etc.

#### Difficulty - 5/10
```
Not that difficult. I wouldn't characterize any unit of the course to be challenging.
```

#### Enjoyment - 7/10
```
Pretty cool. Really like learning about the backend stuff, and we also did some
sql injection which introduced me to cyber security.
```

### Technical Communication in Computer Science
This course is designed to help students become more effective and confident writers in the 
context of the computing profession. Students will be introduced to a broad range of written 
and oral presentation styles used in the computing workplace., COMP 3040 (not a degree requirement). 
This is a really unique class that goes into documentation and presentation. It was never really
anything I considered, but this is actually a really important class. When you start working
professionally, you will learn very quickly how important documentation is. Especially in
the entry level years of your career, you will be tasked with creating and working with
documentation.

#### Difficulty - 2/10
```
Not difficult at all. I don't remember if I actually had to code at all. However,
you do a lot of writing. If you're not good at writing essays or communicating, consider
taking this class to improve on this skills, you will need them.
```

#### Enjoyment - 8/10
```
Way more interesting than I thought it would be. You can make a whole career out of being
a technical writer, and get paid good money. Consider this course if you like writing,
and you like supporting dev operations from a different angle.
```

### Computer Graphics 1
An introductory course in computer graphics including topics such as raster graphics, two and three 
dimensional transforms, and simple rendering., COMP 3490 (not a degree requirement). 
A class that goes into how graphics work. Uses lots of what you learned in MATH 1300.
This is a class you take if you want to get into video games. A mistake I made
was that I didn't consider the math enough, and I ended up losing a lot of marks
because I focused on the graphics concepts.

#### Difficulty - 5/10
```
Not difficult. Some aspects are challenging and confusing, but not too much for anyone to
handle. Like I said before, study up on the math parts because a lot of your marks will
come from that.
```

#### Enjoyment - 7/10
```
Learned a lot about how graphics work, and a lot of this can be applied to video game
development. Take this course if that is something that interests you.
```


## üè´ YEAR FOUR
The last part of your degree. You more or less choose how you want to end off your academic career.
The final push towards getting that parchment and move on to the next chapter of your life.
It is going to be difficult, but so rewarding.


### Real-Time Systems
An introduction to the theory and practice of real-time systems. Topics include the design of 
real-time systems, scheduling, event based processing, and real-time control. COMP 4550 (not a degree requirement). 
The worst course I have ever taken. The prof I had somehow made introductory concepts become
confusing and hard to understand. Course organization was pitiful. Ask a question the prof
doesn't like and you may be humiliated. This course should not be difficult, it should be fun.
I could go on and on about how this course can be improved, but if you want to work with
what this course teaches, try opting for the robotics class offered by Athabasca (I don't
know if the credits can still be transferred at the time of writing).

#### Difficulty - 9/10
```
Difficult in terms of dealing with the prof. Topics such as PID systems are not difficult,
but somehow this class made it seem like it was rocket science. Allow this class to be
taught by the right prof, and it will be a fan favorite. Avoid this class.
```

#### Enjoyment - 1/10
```
Was not fun. Had high hopes, ended up very disappointed. Liked working with hardware but
ended up hating this class for all the wrong reasons.
```

### Professional Practice in Computer Science
Background and rationale to view Computer Science in a professional context. Examination of professional ethics, 
intellectual property, and privacy considerations important to Computer Scientists. COMP 4620. 
An interesting course going over the broader picture in the CS industry. Lots of discussions
and writing. I don't think you do any coding.

#### Difficulty - 2/10
```
Not difficult. Mostly a warning and eye opener on what the industry is like in terms of
legal and ethical issues.
```

#### Enjoyment - 7/10
```
I found it fun to talk to my classmates and hear their opinions. My prof was Christina and she was
really nice!
```


## FAQs

### Is computer science worth it?
This is a tough question to answer. It varies from individual to individual. I'll give my opinion.
If you are only in it for the money, this is going to be very difficult. You need to enjoy this.
IT is such a broad topic. So many avenues for you to explore and find your niche. Web Dev, Databases,
Pen-Testing, Full-stack, Robotics, Research, etc.

If you want to do CS, do you need university? Not necessarily, but your success will vary. If you
love CS, coding, and want to work for FAANG, you need to go to university, get into coop, and take
this seriously. However, I know people who finished a 2 year program, began working in IT, then slowly
work their way to a $85,000 job working in sysadmin and DBA work.

Additionally, the current industry is so tough. If all you do is read r/cscareerquestions and
r/cscareerquestionsCAD, you are going to get depressed really fast. It is hard, yes. It will be
difficult to get a job. But you can be someone totally average like me, and find your way to
a good job!

It is going to get more and more difficult with everyone majoring in CS. Consider this going forward,
you really need to want it to be successful. Consider investing in yourself, building projects, getting
certs (A+, Sec+, CISSP, Databricks cert, PMP, etc).

### What do you regret?
I regret not making enough friends. I'm really introverted, but I am good at working in a team,
presenting, etc. What you will not be taught is how to network. Make friends. Knowing the right
people can literally get you a job. There are so many people that knew someone from school, and
asked them "hey, I'm applying to your company, can you pass my resume to HR?"

This is huge. If you don't get into coop and get experience, this can be your way to a job. I cannot stress this enough.
Join clubs. Make friends. Do presentations at events. Take part. Take initiative.

### How many classes did you take per semester?
Years one to two, I took four classes. After that, I started taking three at most. I could do this
because I took coop, and I no longer needed to rush to graduate. This helped me a lot. Another benefit
of coop I guess.

This answer is difficult because everyone deals with stress differently. You could take four, even five,
classes per semester, but it will be really hard. Your mental health is something you need to
consider. You will feel burnt out. Find out what works for you. Three worked for me.

### What is the difference between school and work?
Huge difference. I am not that smart, but I have always done really well in work. It's just different.
You work in a team. You do your own research and studies to learn how to do things. There is, generally,
room to adapt and do things in a way that is not so rigid in comparison to school. Having a bad GPA
is not the end for you, but you need to learn from your mistakes.

From the first year, consider your study methods. Constantly improve them. Think about sleep,
school-life balance, your physical health, what parts of CS you enjoy, what you are good at, etc.
You can excel after school, just take chances and find out what you enjoy.

### What study strategies work best for Computer Science courses?
Brainscape is amazing for memorization. You don't need to pay for premium. Utilize the flash cards
for classes it can be applied to.

Don't just read your notes. Take what you learn and put it into practice. Learn
to work with pseudo code and build from there. Don't just jump into it and start coding. Make a plan,
and know where you need to go.
